/**
 * Starting application for running multiple simulations of CrapsGame. This
 * gathers statistics (how many games were a win, and how many were a loss), and
 * prints out the results.
 *
 * 
 * You can vary the behavior of this simulation by changing the Dice object that
 * is used in it. It is set up with two Die dice, but you can replace one or
 * both of these with CrookedDie1 or CrookedDie2 dice instead.
 * 
 * 
 * This application (including supporting classes) is meant to illustrate how
 * inheritance can be used to build a simple OO framework which allows easy
 * changes of behavior *without* needing to change much code.
